# JavaScript Library Boilerplate

<http://benalman.com/projects/javascript-library-boilerplate/>

Why go through the tedium of creating both a closure AND a .noConflict method when all you want to do is create your own JavaScript Library? With JavaScript Library Boilerplate, you can hit the ground running and create your own JavaScript Library in no time!

[project]: http://benalman.com/projects/javascript-library-boilerplate/

## Getting Started

Fork the repo. Change the `name` and `$` function. And rename the .js file. And change any references to `QSA` or `qsa` to your new name. And edit the unit tests. And document everything. Or just use [jQuery](http://jquery.com/).

More complete instructions are available at the [project page][project].

## QSA

For more information on the included blazingly-fast 0.3kb QSA css selector library, visit the [project page][project].
